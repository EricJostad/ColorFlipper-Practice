# ColorFlipper-Practice

This is a color flipper app that has two versions: Simple and Advanced. 

The Simple page cycles through a set color array with each press of the "Click Me" button. As the name implies, it is a limited color showing.

The Advanced page is a step above by using a larger color ("adv") array that employs a for-loop to loop over the array many times. Using a random number function, the for-loop provides a near-infinite hex color combination and color output. 

This app was created by following Free Code Camps Vanilla JavaScript tutorial, located here:
